      He shouts.
      Shocks them into silence.
  g2:
    text: |
      The first time a bomb exploded, he thought he'd gone deaf in his other ear too.
  g3:
    text: |
      George scowls at the grandchildren.
      Bloody kids. Wish they'd bloody shut up.
      Go play outside, he wants to tell them. In his day they played outside, come rain or shine… in his day…
  g4:
    text: |
      Fire engines - it was the fire engines he saw first, then everyone running. He started running too.
      Pranged on the runway, someone said.
  g5:
    text: |
      Kill the noise
      deaden the fear

    text: |
      Where are Lauren and Chloe? That damned annoying game, they play it all the time - and she can see it's irritating him.
      Where are they? Under the table? Ha!…

      Let them play.

      Lauren wants something, but Grandma says, ask Grandad. Alison wonders why her mother always says that… ask Grandad, ask your father… they'll never ask Grandad, she should know that by now.

      Blue Tits nesting in their garden… Alison remembers…
      The bird box, up so high and the chicks can't fly! How do they get down? It worries her.
      Mummy's busy. Ask Daddy, she says, like always… but Daddy shouted at her earlier.
      Instead, quiet as a mouse beneath the box, she tries to build a safety net for the little chicks. But when Daddy sees her he shouts at her even worse than before for disturbing them!
      …and she was quiet as a mouse.

    text: |
      He's told them, anything can set it off - loud noises, high-pitched, piercing noises… alarms
  g7:
    text: |
      What's that bloody racket? Bloody kids! Playing havoc with his tinnitus.
      Set it off now. Bloody kids! Get the hell out!
      Seeing them freeze like that, eyes wide… he feels bad… more angry…
      Just shut it! Shut it! Get the hell out!

      For Christ's sake, yes, he knows they're only playing - he knows that.
      Do they think he's stupid or something? It's the bloody ringing.
  g8:
    text: |
      He tried a hearing aid once. Never again! Bloody thing made his tinnitus worse - amplified it!

      A bloody swindle.
  g9:
    text: |
      Explosions!

      Run!
  g10:
    text: |
      The day he joined the air cadets, he was on cloud nine.
      He told his Mam, he was going to be a pilot.
  a4:
    text: |
      She tries to talk to him again about a hearing aid - the digital ones...
      Was that a flicker of interest in his face?
      Maybe…
      No.
      He's angry. Why? She's only trying to help.

      Why does he never listen to her?
  a5:
    text: |
      It crosses her mind to tell the children to turn the volume down. After all, this a family get together, Sunday lunch, she ought to try to keep the peace… she ought to

      ...but really, it's not so noisy, is it?
  a6:
    text: |
      War films - out of all the films for grownups, they're her favourites. She likes musicals too, but war films, the ones with fighter planes, like what Daddy did, are best. She watches them on the telly in winter, lying on the rug in front of the crackling fire.


# scene 2 ---------------------------------------
- g11:
    text: |
      He's running, running to the burning plane
      everyone's running
      stand back! some one shouts
      but he wasn't going any closer
      he's just a fitter
  g12:
    text: |
      What's wrong with books? Don't kids read books anymore... quietly?
      Why doesn't she make them stop playing with that blasted toy?
  g13:
    text: |
      Kids these days! No idea how to behave at the dinner table. For Christ's sake! That's not how she was brought up. Quiet at meal times.
      What's Edna talking about now with them two? The three of them, thick as thieves. What's that they're saying? What are they planning now? He might as well be bloody invisible.
  g14:
    text: |
      Hearing aids? A bloody swindle. Salesmen, out to line their pockets. Don't they understand? Bloody thing made his tinnitus worse - amplified it! Never again! He won't be conned again.
  g15:
    text: |
      He shouts

      it's a blessed relief to shout

      spit fire to stop it dead
  a7:
    text: |
      He won't even entertain the idea of a hearing aid. What more can she do to explain? She's shown him the pictures - how discrete it is. It's infuriating. Doesn't make sense. It makes her so mad it

      hurts.
  a8:
    text: |
      She sits in her place around the dining table, acutely aware of her father sitting next to her. She's on his bad side, his deaf side - the place she's always sat since childhood. Her husband, Mark's on his good side.

      She keeps the conversation flowing with Mark and her mother, in that direction only, as if there's a blank side on her right - a blank wall. She's aware she's doing it, but she doesn't stop herself. She thinks she can't.
  a9:
    text: |
      It's fun playing with the new telephone - she likes putting her fingers in the holes to dial the numbers and pretending to answer the way Mummy does - Hello, this is the Foster residen…

      Stop playing silly buggers! Daddy shouts at her.


# scene 3 ---------------------------------------
- g16:
    text: |
      Try to keep a lid on it. Keep it buttoned. He eats the Sunday roast without tasting it.
  g17:
    text: |
      unfit for flying
      better be a fitter
      dashed hopes
      crushed/crashed*
  g18:
    text: |
      He hears snatches of their conversation, sees their smiles. He can't piece things together. What's the point? What's the bloody point? Their smiles - exchanging smiles between themselves. He cuts into his roast beef. Interrupts, demands salt, more gravy, potatoes, cabbage…. They hand him stuff and carry on talking.
  g19:
    text: |
      The child cries…
      but when he was a boy no one ever came to him when he cried
  g20:
    text: |
      He'd spend hours making model aeroplanes
      listening to the radio
      making model planes
      dreaming of flying
  a10:
    text: |
      Never listens to her. Never has.
      Always: Shut up… Go away… Be quiet…
      As if her presence was painful to him
      …and she was always so quiet (as a mouse).
      She knew better than to scream and squeal.

      Not that she couldn't have fun… to be fair
      He could be fun too.
  a11:
    text: |
      A sharp hissing word. Alison turns and catches a glimpse of hateful anger on her father's face. He was looking at Chloe. She sees fear in her youngest child and the mystifying shame of having provoked such wrath. But it's only there for a moment. Gone now… all gone.
  a12:
    text: |
      Daddy's always reading books about fighter pilots and sometimes he tells her stories from them…
      well mainly he tells Mummy, but she listens too. He says it's a miracle they lived to tell the tale.

      But her favourite wartime stories are the funny ones, like his heroic battle against bedbugs in some hot sandy country.


# scene 4 ---------------------------------------
- g21:
    text: |
      They'd complain if he started reading his book now… World War II biographies - RAF are his favourite, of course - and autobiographies, he prefers them… It's a miracle they lived to tell the tale. He's read them all. He's read them all.
  g22:
    text: |
      He can't ignore how many don't come back - working on Spitfires, the damage they sustain, the holes he has to patch…

      Bloody glad he doesn't fly this crate - but keep a lid on it
      careless whispers…
  g23:
    text: |
      He still dreams of flying a glider - peaceful quiet flight, like the birds
  g24:
    text: |
      Turn a deaf ear. Ignore it and maybe it'll go away… go away

      …go away
  g25:
    text: |
      Defensive fire
      preemptive strikes
      shout before things get out of control
  a13:
    text: |
      He can't hear birdsong anymore. Why does her mother always mention this? As if that's an important thing?
  a14:
    text: |
      Alison talks about the new treatment for Tinnitus she read about on the internet.
      He's listening. Is he listening for once?
      She turns to him, tries to explain.
      But no - objections, one after the other, won't give her a fair hearing.

      Listen to me!

      Her argument shot down in flames.
  a15:
    text: |
      She's bored. Can't see a thing through Daddy's binoculars, just blank sky. What's there to see anyway? Just birds flying around. They don't do anything… but fly. It's boring.


# scene 5 ---------------------------------------
- g26:
    text: |
      He tells them about the book he's reading on the Battle of Britain. They listen for a while…

      Edna starts to clear the table. Karen fusses over the kids. A glass of juice falls over.

      He spits fire
  g27:
    text: |
      Alarm
      There's a boy/pilot* trapped in burning plane, screaming for his mother
      must've pranged on take off
  g28:
    text: |
      in the same old tailspin… down, down in slow, slow motion… alone
  g29:
    text: |
      A hero feels no shame. Is that why he didn't make the grade?
      A fighter pilot is shame free
      That's a hero

      but 9 times out of 10,  a dead hero
  g30:
    text: |
      Frightened
      but shameful to feel so much fear
      ashamed ashamed
      he fears the shame
  a16:
    text: |
      Doubts… thoughts she wants to erase. Should she protect them more, Lauren and Chloe, from his anger? Should she?

      But it doesn't do them any harm, not really, does it? Only frightens them for moment. No lasting damage. They're not with him everyday… not like she was as a child.
  a17:
    text: |
      He spits fire. What's the matter now? He wouldn't treat strangers like this. That's what she resents.

      Let the children play. Play! What the hell!

      playing with fire	[faint]
  a18:
    text: |
      When Daddy was a boy he built model aeroplanes because in the war he was a fighter pilot… like she's seen on the films…

      That's odd… He was nothing more than an aircraft fitter. Alison knows that now.
      It's not that he lied, he didn't lie to her, she just assumed...
      Daddy was a hero.


# scene 6 ---------------------------------------

    text: |
      Perfect soundless flight
      gliding in the blue blue
      sky like the birds
      silent gliding

      glide to silencing peace
  g32:
    text: |
      Cowardly relief
      he failed to make the grade
      nothing but a fitter
      Thank God for his gammy ear
      better a fitter than a dead pilot
      shameful thoughts
  g33:
    text: |
      He spits fire, shooting them down with his angry words
      He hurts them, frightens them - he can see that
      but he can't stop
      in a tailspin
  g34:
    text: |
      He can do nothing. Can't help.
      He watches the boy/pilot* trapped in the burning plane
      Screaming for his mother!
      that's the most horrifying thing
  g35:
    text: |
      Safe. Keep safe.
      Deaf is safe. Thank God!

      Hearing = death

      Hang onto deafness for dear life!
  a19:
    text: |
      He drops the salt cellar. She looks at him and is pierced by a shard of tenderness.
      He looks so vulnerable… lonely.

      A phantom limb, a hand reaches out to him… It could be her own…
      It could be…

      But there's a block - a red hot burning block in the way.
      She can't shift it. Hides behind it. Guards it jealously. After all…
      it's her rightful legacy.

      That's what she believes and she's not giving up on that.
  a20:
    text: |
      She takes the girls into the other room.
      Leave him in peace, that's the best thing.

      Leave him alone.
  a21:
    text: |
      Up, up and away! Daddy always gets the kite flying high… making it swoop and dive… It's not fair! every time she takes the string it nosedives and prangs

      …but Daddy gets it flying again… Up, up and away!
